### 👋 Hi, I’m **Janakiraman K** — a dreamer, builder, and blockchain engineer shaping the future with code.

Ever since I wrote my first line of code, I felt something shift inside me — not just because I was interacting with a machine, but because I realized I could **create worlds** with just logic, intention, and imagination. Today, I’m not just a student of engineering — I’m a **creator of ecosystems**, an architect of decentralized futures, and a passionate advocate of using technology for purposeful, paradigm-shifting innovation.

I’m currently pursuing my **Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology** at *Jaya Engineering College* (Class of 2026), and my academic journey has been both a launchpad and a testing ground for my real-world ventures. With a current CGPA of **8.89**, I’ve maintained a solid academic foundation while simultaneously leading and building high-impact technical projects that explore the bleeding edge of **Web2, Web3, AI, and beyond**.

## 💡 My Philosophy as a Builder

At my core, I believe in **building with intent**. Code is not just syntax to me — it’s poetry with purpose. Every application, every backend system, every smart contract I write serves a clear function in solving real problems — whether in **education, justice, finance, or community engagement**.

I also believe in **ownership and empowerment**. That’s why I love blockchain. It’s not just about decentralization; it’s about restoring trust, ensuring transparency, and enabling **self-sovereign digital identities**.

And above all, I value **simplicity**. Not everything has to be complicated. My design, architecture, and UX decisions are always made with the end user in mind — clean, fast, futuristic, and functional.

**Why it matters**: In a world where digital evidence can be manipulated easily, BlockSentinel acts as a **guardian of truth**. It empowers law enforcement and victims with a **transparent, auditable, and decentralized proof system**.

**Features**:

* Role-based access: users, authorized personnel, admins
* CRUD-enabled blockchain evidence with version history
* AI verifier to check image/document tampering
* Complaint registration, FIR uploads, and secure access control
* Evidence immutability with verifiable metadata on-chain

This is one of the projects closest to my heart — it blends AI, blockchain, real-world justice, and digital security all in one.

## 🎨 Design Aesthetic

Every project I build reflects my visual taste:

* **Minimal yet animated**
* Black, orange, and white themes
* 3D transitions using modern CSS and JS animation libraries
* Consistent use of Tailwind and Shadcn/UI for elegance

Design isn’t separate from engineering — it’s how the logic feels when experienced.

## 🔐 Core Values I Work By

1. **Integrity Before Innovation** – What you build must be trusted before it's admired.
2. **User First** – No feature is useful unless it's usable.
3. **Learn Daily, Build Relentlessly** – I code every day and learn every night.
4. **Everything is Figure-outable** – No error, bug, or unknown tech scares me.
5. **Own Your Stack** – I don’t wait for permission to build. I just build.
